# United House Productions

## Development

Basically have two terminal windows open

One running `npm run server:dev` for the express server

And another running `npm run client:dev` for the react client in dev mode

## Deployment

Run `npm install` (and hopefully `postinstall` is triggered ðŸ¤ž)and then `npm run start` ðŸ˜€

## Scripts

### `npm run start`

Starts the express server

### `npm run server:dev`

Starts the express server in reload mode

### `npm run postinstall`

Automatically builds react client after `npm install`

### `npm run client:dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm run client:test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run client:build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run client:eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

**PLEASE NEVER RUN THIS**
